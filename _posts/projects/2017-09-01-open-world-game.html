description: This is my first approach to a serious project in C++. The idea is that you can run around in a computer-generated world, kill monsters, meet other players and build a base to protect your belongings. The presented game was built on the object-oriented model, runs multiple threads to perform different tasks, uses shaders to improve the visual experience and has an isometric graphics(2.5D). I was using CMake to ensure easy port to Linux based systems on completion.

<h1>1. Introduction</h1>
<p>
    This is my first approach to a serious project in C++. The idea is that you can run around in a computer-generated world, kill monsters, meet other players and build a base to protect your belongings. The presented game was built on the object-oriented model, runs multiple threads to perform different tasks, uses shaders to improve the visual experience and has an isometric graphics(2.5D). I was using CMake to ensure easy port to Linux based systems on completion.

<h1>2. About the game</h1>
<p>
The game is using a <u>client-server model</u>.  The <u>game world</u> was generated using 2D noises. There were two kind of biomes: grassy and woody. The wind was also procedurally generated. The game world is completely my work. It is animated using geometry shaders. The game featured a fully functional chat system and a basic inventory system.
</p>
<h1>3. Conclusions</h1>
<p>
Since this was my first big project I wasn't expecting too much. I was quickly facing issues that would require whole rework to be fixed. The performance was horrible because of the high number of drawcalls. This could be solved by z-ordering or instancing but none of those were supported by the graphics library I was using. I made a version where I put every piece of the grass into a single drawcall but without the proper ordering it just didn't feel the same.

<h1>4. Video</h1>
This is the less performant the graphically correct version of the final game.
