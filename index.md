<h1>Welcome!</h1>

My name is Nándor Szalma. I'm currently studying Computer Science at <a href="https://www.uni-neumann.hu/en_GB/home" target="_blank">John von Neumann University</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kecskemét" target="_blank">Kecskemét/Hungary</a>. I'm mainly interested in high-&shy;performance computing, computer graphics, robots and smart devices. This is going to be a place where I publish my thoughts that I feel worth sharing. You can find out more about my ongoing projects on my  <a href="https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter }}" target="_blank">Twitter</a> page.

I'm passionate about programming. My programming language of choice is C++ because It's efficient, widely supported and directly translates into machine code.
